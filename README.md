# godot-snippets
Some snippets shared across projects

## Instructions

Go into the directory where you want to add this repository, then do this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohnDevlopment/godot-snippets.git
git submodule init .
git submodule update
cd godot-snippets
./install.sh
```

Copy and pase the absolute path to the root of a Godot project. It will detect whether there is a `project.godot` file or not. Make sure you have the right permissions to run these actions.
